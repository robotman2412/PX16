Requirements for multicore:
	- Alt core startup system
	- Core detection
	- Mutex hardware
	- Memory sharing plan

Nice-to-haves:
	- Core affine MMIO copies
	- Core affine RAM
	- Inter-Processor interrupts
	- Dual port RAM

When all the nice to haves are included, the cores are linked by:
	RAM (non-core affine part)
	Inter-Processor interrupts
	Mutex hardware

Viability:
	Dual port RAM chips are expensive, which means most likely dedicated circuitry.
	Dual port ROM is basically not a thing, which means that ROM must be copied before use.
	
	Creating two copies of all MMIO will be expensive and time-consuming because combined MMIO might be more complex than the core.

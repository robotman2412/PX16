Tha PX16 bodge:
	1x	PX16 (16-bit) CPU, 16Kw ROM-ish, 64 Kw RAM
	1x	Hardware timer with 1 limit
	10x	Buttons

Power modes:
	On:
		Powered on, CPU running continuously.
		Default state.
	Idle:
		Powered on, CPU resumes on interrupt.
		Entered by running the HLT instruction.
		All states are preserved on exit.
	Light sleep:
		Powered on, power CPU restored on button press.
		Entered by updating power mode register.
		CPU will reset on exit, but RAM will not.
	Deep sleep:
		Powered off, power restored on button press.
		Entered by updating power mode register.
		CPU and RAM will reset on exit.
	Off:
		Powered off, battery disconnected.
		Entered by turning off the power switch.

Examples:
	On:
		Calculations, games and fun things.
	Idle:
		Little or no usage of CPU time.
	Light sleep:
		Waiting for inputs, saving power when nothing is happening.
	Deep sleep:
		Not in immediate use, saving power.
	Off:
		Not in use for an extended period of time.

MMIO:

	0xfffd - Button input
	0xfffc - Timer 0 mode		(8-bit)
	0xfffb - Timer 0 low
	0xfffa - Timer 0 high
	0xfff9 - Limit 0 low
	0xfff8 - Limit 0 high
	0xfff7 - MPU 3 end
	0xfff6 - MPU 3 start

	0xfff4 - MPU 2 start
	0xfff3 - MPU 1 end
	0xfff2 - MPU 1 start
	0xfff1 - MPU 0 end
	0xfff0 - MPU 0 start
	0xffef - MPU mode

Power measurement register:
	Used to read the battery value.
	Range will depend on measurement circuitry.

Power mode register: .... .... DL.. .TBS
	D: Deep sleep:   Turns off power to CPU and RAM when 1.
	L: Light sleep:  Turns off power to CPU when 1.
	T: Timer state:  Timers may wake from sleep.
	B: Button state: Buttons may wake from sleep.
	S: Screen state: Enables the screen when 1.

Button input:
	    .---.                      .-.

	          \__8__\     \__9__\         

Timer mode register: .... .... RW.. ..IE
	R: Read value:   Read current value to intermediary registers.
	R: Write value:  Write intermediary registers current value.
	I: Interrupts:   Send an interrupt when the limit is reached.
	E: Enable:       Enable the timer.

MPU start / end registers:
	Used to set the part of memory affected by this zone.

MPU mode register:   ERWX.RWX.RWX
	E: Enable memory protection unit.
	R: Allow reading in zone.
	W: Allow writing in zone.
	X: Allow code execution in zone.

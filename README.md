# Pixie 16
A 16-bit simple-as-possible\* RISC CPU.
Has conditional `MOV` instructions (which is also how branching happens),
And a few math instructions.


Has 4 general registers: `R0`, `R1`, `R2`, `R3`

And 3 special registers: `ST` (stack register), `PF` (flags register), `PC` (program counter)


Note: RISC is not equal to RISC-V.

# TODO

- Interrupts
- Emulator
